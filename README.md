As a software developer with a passion for integrating machine learning, I am skilled in writing well-designed, testable, and efficient code using current best practices.

With a strong foundation in software engineering and experience in various scripting languages, I am a fast learner, hard worker, and team player. My expertise in developing user-friendly and responsive web interfaces, automating tasks, and implementing RESTful web APIs/services has helped me in designing and implementing web applications that exceed user expectations. 

Additionally, my experience in machine learning integration including computer vision, NLP, and other techniques has allowed me to develop powerful models that can analyze and classify complex data.
